In order to create our training and testing data, we
extracted 3000 pull requests events that were made in the
window from 04/01/2012 to 04/14/2012. After data
sanitization and filtering, this resulted in 2734 usable data
points. For some features such as contrib_prob and
repo_prob (as reflected in Table 1), we ran queries on
GitHub Archive using Google BigQuery to get information
such as the number of successful pull requests and total
number of pull requests made for each contributor and
repository.
In search of predictive features, we realized our data set
did not have an explicit representation for some of the
features we were interested in. For example, the number of
collaborators for a given repository was not directly
provided, and we had to use the Github API to extract this
information. Because data fetching via the Github API is
slow and we are only limited to only 5000 API calls an
hour, we wrote a web cache to cache all pages that we
fetched
